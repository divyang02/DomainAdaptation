"the last time, when i checked the deployed app on / / , the app was not working. however,it seems to be working fine now. the layout of the app is clean and simple and easy to follow. there was no confusion in navigating the app. however, it took quite some time to enter the address in proper format. same goes for the website and revenue while creating a company. you may put a sample address and phone number in the readme if you are strictly restricting the format. when applying for a job as a job-seeker, the error prompt for the portfolio format says that it should be of the form http(s)://www.website.com/org/etc however it only accepts the format http(s)://www.website.com. the same issue arised while creating a company while signed in as a recruiter. otherwise, the readme file is very detailed and helps the user to understand the working of the app very well. it could be a little brief or be displayed as bullet points instead of paragraphs to make it easier to read.&nbsp;",1,1,1,185
"the code for the most part follows good coding practices.the code is clearly written and is easy to understand for the most part.however, the use of comments especially for non-scaffold generated methods will help the user to understand the code much better. for eg:- filter function in the jobs controller. some of the empty-body methods can be written in a single line for eg:- ""show"" and ""edit"" method in users_controller. in the applications controller, there are parameters ""j_id"" and ""job_id"" which is slightly confusing. also, there are two controllers application_controller for authorization of users and applications_controller which handles crud methods for job applications. you could name it differently to avoid confusion. methods for destroying and closing an application have been defined in the model ""application.rb"" and similarly, in the job model file ""job.rb"" this negates the use of mvc architecture where the controller controls the interpretation of actions. &nbsp;",1,1,1,155
"the code is clear and easy to follow. however, it is pretty much the basic code generated by scaffold generation. in the authorize method of the application controller, the notice just says ""xyz"". this could be changed to a more specific message.the homepage controller has only two empty methods, create and new. this implies that its function is just to manipulate the views. i feel that this could be implemented in the user controller itself instead of creating a new controller for it.",1,1,1,84
the user interface is very easy to use and attractive. the interface displays all the required information and links so that the user can easily access the application.,-1,-1,-1,28
"the code follows ruby and rails best practices to the best extent possible. most of the code is generated by scaffold so follows the systematic hierarchy of the scaffold. the authors have also put comments wherever necessary, which is helpful. the code is also properly indented as per ruby standards.",-1,-1,-1,50
the team kept on pushing their changes throughout the project period. the number of commits is also good that is which is clear indication that the team is working on the project throughout the project period.,-1,-1,-1,36
